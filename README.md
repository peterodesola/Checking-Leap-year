## Introduction
This project implements a leap year checker using Python. It takes a year as input from the user and determines whether it is a leap year based on the standard Gregorian calendar rules.
## Technical Implementation
The code leverages the following Python concepts:
## Input and Type Conversion
The input() function prompts the user to enter a year. The input is then converted to an integer using int(), as years are whole numbers.
## Modulo Operator and Conditional Logic
The core logic of the leap year determination relies on the modulo operator (%) and nested if-else statements. The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division. The leap year rules are implemented as follows: 
If a year is divisible by 4, it is potentially a leap year.
However, if a year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, unless it is also divisible by 400. In that case, it is a leap year.
## Output
The print() function displays the result, indicating whether the entered year is a "Leap year" or "Not leap year."
## Project Significance and Impact
This project demonstrates a clear understanding of conditional logic and the use of the modulo operator for solving a specific problem. It provides a concise and accurate implementation of the leap year determination rules. While seemingly simple, it highlights the importance of precise logical thinking in programming.
## Potential Enhancements
Input Validation: Adding input validation to ensure the user enters a valid year (e.g., a positive integer) could enhance the robustness of the code.
## Function Definition
Encapsulating the leap year checking logic within a function would improve code organization and reusability. This would allow the function to be called with different years without repeating the core logic.
## User Experience
While the current implementation works, it could be made more user-friendly by providing more context in the output (e.g., "2024 is a leap year").
## Conclusion
This leap year checker project is a good example of how Python can be used to implement specific rules and algorithms. It showcases the use of fundamental programming concepts and provides a solid foundation for more complex projects involving date and time calculations. It's a valuable addition to a portfolio, demonstrating the ability to translate logical rules into functional code.
